# Queues-in-C
Queues in C Language

Like Stack, Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).  A good example of queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first.
The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.

Types of Queues:
  - Normal and Circular Buffer Memory Allocation using Arrays : Adding at rear end and Popping at front end.
  - Double - Ended Queues: Adding and Popping from both ends of the Queue.
  - Priority Queues: Adding elements and removing according to the Priority of the element. Priority is given along with the value of that element. 

Operations on Queues:
  - Enqueue: Adding Elements to Queue
  - Dequeue: Removing/Deleting Elements from Queue
