# C-Programming

Here you can find different C programs from different topics in C Programming

- [Linked List in C](Linked_List_in_C/)
  - A linked list is a set of dynamically allocated nodes, arranged in such a way that each node contains one value and one pointer. The pointer always points to the next member of the list. If the pointer is NULL, then it is the last node in the list.
A linked list is held using a local pointer variable which points to the first item of the list. If that pointer is also NULL, then the list is considered to be empty.
  - Advantages: Dynamic of Size, Easy Insertion or delection.
  - Drawbacks: Random Access in not Allowed, Extra Memory to store Pointer is required
  - Examples: 
    - [Singly Linked List - Basic Operations](Linked_List_In_C/Singly Linked List - Basic Opertion.c)

- [Stacks in C](Stacks_in_C/)
  - A Stack is a data structure which is used to store data in a particular order. Two operations that can be performed on a Stack are: Push operation which inserts an element into the stack. Pop operation which removes the last element that was added into the stack. It follows Last In First Out(LIFO) Order. A stack overflow is an undesirable condition in which the program tries to use more memory space than the call stack has available. If a Stack is empty and yet a Pop operation is attempted, then it results in Stack Underflow condition.
