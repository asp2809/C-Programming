Searching Using C Language

  - [Linear Search](Searching/LinearSearch.c/)
    - Algorithm:
      - Start from the leftmost element of arr[ ] and one by one compare x with each element of arr[ ]
      - If x matches with an element, return the index.
      - If x doesnâ€™t match with any of elements, return -1.
    - Time Complexity: O(n) where, n = Size of arr.
