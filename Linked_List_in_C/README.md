Linked Lists using C Language

A Linked List is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links.
Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array.

Types of Linked Lists :

      Simple Linked List (or Singly Linked List) : Item navigation in forward direction only.
      
      Doubly Linked List : Item navigation can forward or backwards
      
      Circular Linked List : Last item contains the link to first element, thus forming a circular linked list.
 
 Basic Operation : 
 
      Insertion : Add element to Linked List
      
      Deletion : Delete any element in Linked List
      
      Search : Search for a given number throughout the linked list
      
      Display : Display the complete Linked List.
 
 
:: Josephus Problem ::

In Computer Science and Mathematics, the Josephus Problem (or Josephus Permutation) is a theoretical problem related to a certain counting-out game.

People are standing in a circle waiting to be executed. Counting begins at a specified point in a circle and proceeds around the circle in a specifieddirection. After a specified number of people are skipped, the next person is executed. The procedure is repeated with the remaining people, starting with the next person, going in the same direction and skipping the same number of people, until only one person remains, and is freed. 

This Problem is solved using Singly Linked List here.
