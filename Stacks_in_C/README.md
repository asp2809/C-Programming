Stacks In C Programming

A stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to LIFO principle (LIFO : Last In First Out). The name "stack" for this data type of structure comes from the analogy to a set of physical items stacked on top of each other, which makes it easy to take an item off the top of the stack, while getting to an item deeper in the stack may require taking off multiple other items first.

In the pushdown stacks only two operations are allowed: Push and Pop. Push adds a new element on top of the stack, whereas Pop, removes the Topmost element from stack.

Stacks can be easily implemented in both arrays and linked lists, but ofcourse, both have their share of advantages and disadvantages.
A stack may be implemented to have a bounded capacity (array implementation). If the stack is full and does not contain enough space to accept an entity to be pushed, the stack is considered to be an overflow state. The pop operation removes an item from the top of stack.
